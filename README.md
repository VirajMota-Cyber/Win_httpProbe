# Win_httpProbe
A custom Powerful Window based script to scan for live IPs and detect open ports, similar to the Linux-based HTTProbe tool on GitHub.

I created a custom PowerShell script designed to evade antivirus detection on Windows systems while performing tasks such as scanning live IPs, detecting open ports, and documenting the scan results in an Excel sheet.


How to Use:-
1. Open Powershell Terminal

2. Run below command to allow execution of script over terminal
>powershell -ep bypass

3.Run the script
 >./Win_httpProbe
